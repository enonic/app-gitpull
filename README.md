This Enonic XP application pulls changes from multiple configured git repositories. It also exposes an endpoint that can be
triggered to pull on demand.



## Configuration

To configure this application, just place a file named `com.enonic.app.gitpull.cfg` inside one of your `$XP_HOME` configuration directories. This
file holds a set of repositories to pull from. Every set is named and the keys are described as follows:

* `<name>.url`      - Git URL (only http and https is supported).
* `<name>.user`     - Git server user (optional).
* `<name>.password` - Git server password (optional).
* `<name>.dir`      - Destination directory to checkout.

Here's an example:

```
# Repo one
prod.url = https://some/git/url
prod.user = username
prod.password = password
prod.dir = ${xp.home}/config/prod

# Repo two
dev.url = https://some/git/url
dev.dir = ${xp.home}/config/dev
```

## Usage

Every time the app is triggered, all configured repos will be pulled.  There are three ways to trigger the app:
* Start the server
* Start the app - using the Applications app (after stopping it first), or by (re-)deploying it.
* Using the REST endpoint (method = POST), `/api/ext/gitpull`.  The request must be authenticated.
